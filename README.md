# Thermal-Simulations-with-OpenFOAM
In order to accurately simulate infrared imaging, some sort of thermal simulation is required. This repo is for compiling a few simulations that I'll run in order to learn, demonstrate, and ultimately use OpenFOAM for these simulations.

The repo will have several directories, each with its own case. Each case contains a simulation that you can use with openFOAM.
